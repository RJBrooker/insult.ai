## Built With 
* [Gunicorn](http://gunicorn.org/): Python Web Server Gateway Interface
* [hug](https://github.com/timothycrosley/hug): Fast and lightweight Python web framework
* [pyTorch](https://pytorch.org/): Deep learning framework
* [torchMoji](https://github.com/huggingface/torchMoji): Pretrained neural network for predicting emoji icons
* [torchMoji](https://www.kaggle.com/c/detecting-insults-in-social-commentary): Insults in Social Commentary Dataset

The model is built in pyTorch, and trained on Kaggles "Insults in Social Commentary" Dataset. It utilises the power of the torchMoji model through a concept called "transfer learning".

The API handlers are built in hug, then served through a Gunicorn Gateway Interface.
